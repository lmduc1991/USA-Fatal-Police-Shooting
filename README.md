While there are many challenges regarding data collection and reporting, The Washington Post has been tracking more than a dozen details about each killing. This includes the race, age and gender of the deceased, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis. The Washington Post has gathered this supplemental information from law enforcement websites, local new reports, social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as "Killed by police" and "Fatal Encounters". The Post has also conducted additional reporting in many cases.
